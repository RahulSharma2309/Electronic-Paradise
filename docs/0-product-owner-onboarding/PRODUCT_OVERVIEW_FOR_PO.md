# 🎯 Product Overview - The Complete Picture

> **Everything you need to know about what we're building, why, and where we're going**

**Welcome!** This document is your complete guide to understanding our product. It's written in simple, everyday language - no technical jargon required. By the end, you'll understand what we're building, where we are now, and where we're heading.

---

## 🌱 What Are We Building? (The Simple Answer)

We're building **FreshHarvest Market** - an **online organic food marketplace** delivering certified organic products from trusted farms directly to your doorstep.

**What customers can do:**
- Browse organic products (fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, herbs & spices)
- Search and filter by category, certification, origin
- Compare products side-by-side
- Read reviews from other customers
- Verify organic certifications (India Organic, USDA, EU Organic)
- Add items to cart
- Checkout and pay
- Track their orders
- Manage their account

**But wait, there's more!** This isn't just a store - it's also a **learning project**. We're building it to master advanced software engineering skills while creating something real that promotes healthy, sustainable food choices.

---

## 🎯 Why Are We Building This?

### The Business Reason
We want to create a **production-grade organic food marketplace** that:
- Delivers certified organic products reliably
- Works reliably for customers 24/7
- Handles lots of traffic during peak hours
- Has all the features health-conscious customers expect
- Can grow and scale across India

### The Learning Reason
While building this, we're learning:
- How to build complex software systems
- Modern software development practices
- How to work in teams (or solo)
- How to plan and execute large projects

**Think of it like:** Building a house to learn carpentry, plumbing, and electrical work - but the house is real and people can use it!

---

## 🏗️ What Does "Production-Grade" Mean?

**Production-grade** means the software is:
- ✅ **Reliable** - It works when customers need it
- ✅ **Fast** - Pages load quickly, actions happen instantly
- ✅ **Secure** - Customer data is protected
- ✅ **Tested** - We know it works before customers use it
- ✅ **Monitored** - We can see if something goes wrong
- ✅ **Scalable** - Can handle more customers as we grow

**Right now:** We have a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It works, but it's not production-grade yet. That's what we're building toward.

---

## 📊 Where Are We Right Now? (Current Status)

### ✅ What's Already Done (MVP - Completed!)

**Think of MVP like a basic farmers' stall:** It has fresh produce available, customers can browse and buy. But it doesn't have premium features like detailed certifications, farm origin tracking, or advanced filtering yet.

**What customers can do today:**
1. **Sign up and log in** - Create an account, log in securely
2. **Browse products** - See a list of organic products
3. **Add to cart** - Put items in their shopping cart
4. **Checkout** - Buy items using wallet payment (₹)
5. **View orders** - See their order history
6. **Add money to wallet** - Top up their account balance

**What's working behind the scenes:**
- 5 separate services (like different departments in a store)
- Secure authentication (login system)
- Payment processing (in INR)
- Order management
- Product catalog with organic products

**Progress:** We've completed **89 out of 864 story points** (about 10%). The MVP is done, and now we're building the enhanced features.

---

## 🗺️ Where Are We Going? (The Roadmap)

We have a **clear plan** for the next 12-15 months, broken down into **10 major epics** (big feature sets) and **35 sprints** (2-week work periods).

### The Big Picture Timeline

```
Now → 3 months → 6 months → 12 months → 15 months
 │       │          │           │            │
MVP    Better    Trustworthy  Production  Complete
Done   Catalog   Checkout     Ready       Platform
```

### What's Coming Next? (The Next 3 Months)

**Epic 1: Enhanced Product Domain** (We're starting here!)

**Goal:** Make our product catalog feel like a premium organic food marketplace, not just a basic list.

**What customers will see:**
- Products organized by categories (Fresh Fruits, Fresh Vegetables, Grains & Pulses, Dairy & Eggs, Herbs & Spices)
- Product variants (like Organic Rice in different pack sizes: 1kg, 5kg, 10kg)
- Product attributes (organic certifications, farm origin, expiry date, nutritional info)
- Product images and galleries
- Search and filtering by certification, origin, category
- Reviews and ratings
- Wishlist feature
- Product comparison tool

**Why this matters:** Right now, our catalog is basic. After Epic 1, customers will be able to find exactly what they want, verify certifications, compare options, and make informed decisions - just like on BigBasket or Nature's Basket.

### Mission Statement
**"Enable customers to discover, compare, and purchase certified organic products confidently with a checkout experience that is fast, trustworthy, and transparent."**

**In simple terms:** We want customers to feel confident buying organic products from FreshHarvest Market. They should be able to find what they want, verify the organic certifications, understand what they're buying, and trust that fresh, authentic products will be delivered.

### Our Principles (What We Always Follow)

1. **Clarity over cleverness**
   - We make things simple and understandable, not fancy and confusing

2. **Trust is a feature**
   - Customers must trust us - this is as important as any feature

3. **Fast paths for common journeys**
   - The most common things (browse → buy) should be quick and easy

4. **Failure must be safe**
   - If something goes wrong, we handle it gracefully - no lost orders or money

5. **Incremental delivery**
   - We ship improvements regularly, not all at once

## 📊 How We Measure Success

### The Main Metric (North Star)

**Why this matters:** This tells us if customers are actually buying things and coming back. It combines:

- Are they coming back? (active users)
- How often? (per month)

### Other Important Metrics

**Acquisition (Getting customers):**
- How many people sign up?
- Do they find products they like?

**Engagement (Keeping customers):**
- Do they add items to cart?
- Do they come back?
- Do they use wishlist?

**Transaction Health:**
- Do checkouts succeed?
- How often do payments fail?
- How many refunds do we have?

**Quality:**
- How fast does the site load?

## 🗂️ How Work Is Organized

Think of an **Epic** like a major project. For example:

Each epic takes several sprints to complete.

- **PBI 1.2:** Product Variants (pack sizes: 1kg, 5kg, 10kg)
- **PBI 1.3:** Dynamic Pricing (seasonal discounts, bulk pricing)

Each PBI is a specific piece of work that can be completed in a sprint.

### Sprints (2-Week Work Periods)
A **Sprint** is a 2-week period where we:
1. Plan what to work on
2. Build it
3. Test it
4. Review it
5. Start the next sprint

**Current sprint:** We're about to start Epic 1, Sprint 1

## 💡 Common Questions

### "What if I don't understand something technical?"
**Answer:** That's okay! Ask questions. The team is here to help. You don't need to understand every technical detail - you need to understand what we're building and why.

### "How do I know if a feature is 'done'?"
**Answer:** Check the acceptance criteria in the PBI document. If all criteria are met, it's done. See [Definition of Done](../3-product-owner/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) for details.
