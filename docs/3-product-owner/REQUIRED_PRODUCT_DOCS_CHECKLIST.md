# ✅ Required Product Docs Checklist (PM/PO)

This checklist answers: **“What documents does every product need?”**  
It’s written for both **Product Manager** and **Product Owner** responsibilities.

> Tip: Keep this file as the **single checklist**; keep the documents themselves in their own files.

  - **In this repo:** embedded in `PRODUCT_ROADMAP_PM_PO.md` (release slices)

## 3) Execution Layer (How / Build)

- [x] **Engineering roadmap** (epics/PBIs + acceptance criteria)  
  - **File:** `docs/9-roadmap-and-tracking/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`

- [x] **Iteration checklist / sprint execution tracking**  
  - **File:** `docs/9-roadmap-and-tracking/ITERATION_CHECKLIST.md`

## 5) Governance Layer (How decisions are made)

  - **Suggested future doc:** `docs/3-product-owner/DECISION_LOG.md`

- [ ] **Risk register** (top risks, mitigations, owners)  
  - **Suggested future doc:** `docs/3-product-owner/RISK_REGISTER.md`

## Status in This Repo (Today)

- **Already strong on engineering execution**: roadmap, checklists, architecture, flows.
- **This folder fills the PM/PO gap**: vision, personas, SWOT, product roadmap, iteration narrative, DoD.
