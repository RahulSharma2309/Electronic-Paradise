## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Microservices Pattern
```
Frontend (React) → Gateway (YARP) → Services → Databases
                        ↓
            Service-to-Service Communication
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Database-per-Service:** Each service owns its data
2. **API Gateway:** Single entry point for frontend
3. **Platform Library:** Shared infrastructure via NuGet
4. **N-Tier per Service:** Abstraction → Core → API layers
5. **Orchestration:** Order Service orchestrates checkout
6. **Compensation:** Rollback mechanisms for failures

## 🎯 Architecture Principles

### 1. Service Independence
- Each service can be deployed independently
- No shared databases
- Communicate via HTTP/REST

### 2. Platform-First Design
- Infrastructure concerns in Platform library
- Services consume via NuGet package
- Zero direct infrastructure dependencies

### 3. Clear Boundaries
- Each service has well-defined responsibility
- No circular dependencies
- Clear API contracts

### 4. Resilience
- Retry policies (Polly)
- Compensation transactions
- Graceful degradation
